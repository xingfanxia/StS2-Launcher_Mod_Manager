// P0-1 (issue #36 follow-up) — tiny on-disk marker for an AppUploadBatch that
// has been opened (BeginAppUploadBatch succeeded) but not yet confirmed closed
// (CompleteAppUploadBatchBlocking succeeded). Per Valve's ICloudService docs
// (see _workspace/05_steamkit2_research.md Q1), an unclosed batch blocks ALL
// new uploads for this user+app for "several minutes" with a "too many
// pending requests" response — the confirmed root cause of repeated PC
// desync failures. SteamKit2CloudSaveStore.EndSaveBatch's try/finally already
// closes the batch on every in-process exit path, but if the process itself
// dies mid-batch (kill, crash, ANR) that finally never runs. This marker is
// the only way the NEXT session can find out a batch was left open and close
// it — see CloudFileCache.LoadFileList for the cleanup side.
